# Railway Deployment Guide - Step by Step

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal: Deploy Your Pakistan Idol Dashboard to Railway in 15 Minutes**

This guide will help you deploy your app to Railway without any technical knowledge required.

## ðŸ“‹ **What You Need Before Starting**

1. **Your code on GitHub** (if not already there, I'll help you)
2. **A Railway account** (free to sign up)
3. **15 minutes of time**

## ðŸš€ **Step 1: Prepare Your Code for Railway**

### **1.1 Update Database Configuration**

I'll help you change from SQLite to PostgreSQL (Railway provides this automatically).

**File to update:** `drizzle.config.ts`
```typescript
import type { Config } from 'drizzle-kit';

export default {
  schema: './lib/db/schema.ts',
  out: './drizzle',
  dialect: 'postgresql',
  dbCredentials: {
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  },
} satisfies Config;
```

### **1.2 Update Database Connection**

**File to update:** `lib/db/index.ts`
```typescript
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/postgres-js';
import postgres from 'postgres';
import * as schema from './schema';

// Railway automatically provides DATABASE_URL
const client = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
export const db = drizzle(client, { schema });
```

### **1.3 Add Required Dependencies**

**File to update:** `package.json`
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "postgres": "^3.4.3"
  }
}
```

### **1.4 Create Railway Configuration**

**Create new file:** `railway.json`
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start",
    "healthcheckPath": "/api/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 100,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### **1.5 Add Health Check Endpoint**

**Create new file:** `app/api/health/route.ts`
```typescript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function GET() {
  return NextResponse.json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  });
}
```
